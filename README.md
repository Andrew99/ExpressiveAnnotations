ExpressiveAnnotations
=====================

ExpressiveAnnotations is a small .NET library which provides annotation-based conditional validation mechanisms. Given implementation of RequiredIf and RequiredIfExpression attributes allows to forget about imperative way of step-by-step verification of validation conditions in many cases. This in turn results in less amount of code which is also more compacted, since fields validation requirements are applied as metadata, just in the place of such fields declaration.
